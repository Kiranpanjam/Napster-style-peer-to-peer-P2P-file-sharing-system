INTRODUCTION:
Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Technologies are being widely used for sharing the data between the
servers and the clients. One of the major technology for file sharing that is implemented nowadays
is the Napster-Style Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System.
The older versions of the systems used to have a single server which stores the files in its
directory that are received from the clients. The major drawback of these systems was that if a new
file has been created in one of the peers, it must be transferred to the server before another peer
can access it, which delays the process of transfer from one peer to another. This can be conquered
using the Napster system which allows the peer to peer file transfer.


How to Run the Project::
-> Run the makefile using the make command
-> Follow the instructions

For starting different peers (i.e., Clients), use different command prompts for execution
